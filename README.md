We provide a comprehensive dataset of focal stack images. These test sequences cover the field of research and applications, for instance, light field displays, medical image analysis and 3D visual sensing.

The dataset consists of 6 synthetic scenes(Lytro Illum 624x432, YUV420), 3 natural scenes (Canon EOS60D 1024x512, YUV420) and 3 microscopy scenes (Huron TissueScope 1024x1024,YUV420). As far as we know, it is the most representative dataset because these sequences are captured by considering all types of image formation models. 

%The dataset can also be downloaded from Google Drive
